This folder contains code to perform Hyperparameter Tuning using following techniques/libraries:
01. Grid Search CV
02. Random Search CV
03. Gird/Random Search with sklearn Pipelines
04. Bayesian Optimization using SkOpt
05. HyperOpt
06. Optuna

The dataset is for Mobile Price Classification and is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification/data
The initial version of code is based on a youtube video live coding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nYqK-HaoKY

Next Steps to implement:
-- Put the functions in a utils.py code.
-- Add logging to external files through decorators.
-- Provide option to pass input parameters while calling a main model train function.
