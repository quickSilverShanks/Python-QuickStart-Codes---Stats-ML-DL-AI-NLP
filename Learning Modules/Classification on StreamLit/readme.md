Test run streamLit after installing: 'streamlit hello'

Once main.py has been created with some basic code, run StreamLit with 'streamlit run hello.py' and turn on 'Run on Save' settings from top right. Now keep modifying main,.py and webpage will reflect the changes.

Currently, the StreamLit page trains model automatically on every user selection of data/model/parameters.

Next Steps :
-- Add option to upload data and select dependent/independent columns, train-val-test split ratio.
-- Add option to train model/generate predictions only on user selection to do so.
-- Add more classifiers and user option to do feature scaling.
